# BlakBox — Real-Time Log Monitoring & Alerting System

A full-stack **real-time log monitoring dashboard** built with **React.js**, **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, **Elasticsearch**, and **Redis**.  
It provides powerful visualizations for logs, alerts, and error trends across distributed systems — simulating real-world microservice behavior.

---

## Tech Stack

### **Frontend**
- **React.js (TypeScript + MUI + Recharts)**
- Responsive dark-mode dashboard UI  
- Dynamic charts for error trends, severity distribution, and alert visualization  
- REST API integration with the Spring Boot backend  

### **Backend**
- **Spring Boot (Java)**
- RESTful APIs for log ingestion, search, and alert evaluation  
- Kafka producer for event streaming  
- Integrated with Redis and Elasticsearch  

### **Data & Messaging**
- **Apache Kafka** → Message broker for log events (`log-events` topic)  
- **Elasticsearch** → Stores and indexes all logs for search and analytics  
- **Redis** → Caches recent logs for fast dashboard rendering

## System Description

BlakBox continuously ingests logs that are published to Kafka, indexed into Elasticsearch, and cached in Redis.  
These logs are then visualized on a modern, dark-mode dashboard that highlights real-time application health.

> **Note:**  
> While the architecture is designed for a microservices ecosystem, the current setup uses **Python scripts to generate synthetic logs** for services.  
> This allows for realistic testing of alerting and visualization flows without deploying multiple services.

- Tracks error rates for each simulated service  
- Automatically triggers alerts when thresholds (e.g., >5 errors) are breached  
- Displays alert history and trends for the last few days  
- Visualizes alert growth patterns

- Trend chart for total error rate across time  
- Donut chart for **severity distribution** (Error / Info / Warn)  
- Bar chart for **error count per service** — helps identify which service is failing most
